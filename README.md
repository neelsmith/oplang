Specification of a computational system for working with texts in Old Persian cuneiform, and implementations of the specification in code libraries.

The source for the specification is the `specs` directory, and uses [concordion](http://concordion.org/) to bind the specification to excecutable tests.

A version of the specification rendered with live test results is posted [here](http://shot.holycross.edu/~nsmith/oldpersianspec/OldPersian.html).
