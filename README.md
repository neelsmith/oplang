A computational system for working with texts in Old Persian cuneiform.

The system is specified in markdown texts in the `specs/md` directory, and uses [concordion](http://concordion.org/) to bind the specification to excecutable tests as part of the regular gradle `test` task.

A version of the specification rendered with live test results is posted at [http://shot.holycross.edu/~nsmith/oldpersianspec/OldPersian.html](http://shot.holycross.edu/~nsmith/oldpersianspec/OldPersian.html).
