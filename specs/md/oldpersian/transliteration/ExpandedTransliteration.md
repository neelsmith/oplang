# Expanded transliteration #


(Note: to read this specification properly, your browser must be capable of displaying characters outside Unicode's basic multilingual plane, and you must have a font installed covering the Old Persian range of Unicode.)


Need to specify permissible syntax for placement of syllable-break markers in transliteration in relation to expanded characters, and to white space/new lines.

White space should in all events be squeezed out of input in converting to a different represenation.
